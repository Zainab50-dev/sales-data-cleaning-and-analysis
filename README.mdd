# Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis

This is my first Python Pandas project.  
The notebook includes data cleaning, preparation, and analysis of sales data, along with generating basic insights.

# Project Overview
The project follows these main steps:

1.Loading Dataset  
Load the raw sales data using Pandas   
Preview the first few rows of the dataset

2.Handling Missing Values 
Check for null values  
Fill missing values in the TERRITORY column with 'Unknown Region'

3.Dropping Irrelevant Columns  
Removed irrelevant columns 

4.Preparing Date Columns  
Convert ORDERDATE to datetime  
Extract Month and Year for analysis

5.Generating Insights  
Monthly Sales: Total sales per month and year  
Yearly Sales: Total sales per year, sorted descending  
City-wise Sales: Total sales per city, sorted descending  
Top Product Lines: Top 5 product lines by total sales
